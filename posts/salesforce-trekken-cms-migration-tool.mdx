The Salesforce CMS data migration experience is lacking. There is no bulk export, and there is no sorting/filtering of content and you are sent an email link instead of being able to directly download the zip file.

Salesforce Trekken aims to rethink the Salesforce CMS migration experience. Using modern web technologies and thoughtful a user experience, migrating Salesforce CMS data has never been easier.

## How does it work?

Salesforce Trekken allows users to authenticate using one of two methods:

- The [sfdx cli](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm)
- Access Token (and Instance URL)

The [Salesforce REST API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_rest.htm) is used to fetch CMS Channels and the CMS Content after a specific channel has been selected.

## Features

- Multiple Authentication Methods (`sfdx cli` or ACCESS_TOKEN)
- Channel Selection: Choose the right CMS Channel to export data from
- Feature Rich Export Table
- Bundled Zip file export, ready to be imported into your target org.
