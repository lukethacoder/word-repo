# TODO:

- [ ] check which packages we're actually using
- [ ] dynamic banner color based on mdx frontmatter
- [ ] code block enhancements
  - [ ] use github flavoured markdown parser (where are the checkboxes)
  - [ ] language pill/bar/something
  - [ ] line numbers? could be neat? maybe see how prism handles this internally
