A quick guide to the first things I'll setup on a fresh windows machine install before doing anything else.

- [ ] Move OneDrive based folders via regedit ([how to guide](https://appuals.com/fix-cant-move-the-folder-because-there-is-a-folder-in-the-same-location-that-cant-be-redirected/)).
- [ ] Install PowerShell 7 (or the latest version) [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.2).
- [ ] [Set PowerShell `ExecutionPolicy`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.3&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-7.1).
- [ ] Change default terminal editor to VS Code `git config --global core.editor "code"`
- [ ] Update Windows Terminal config with [my config](https://github.com/lukethacoder/.../blob/master/profiles.json).
- [ ] Install the [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
- [ ] Install [git](https://git-scm.com/).
- [ ] Install [Fira Code (Nerd Font)](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).
- [ ] Install [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/windows) and load in [my config](https://github.com/lukethacoder/.../blob/master/oh-my-posh.omp.json).
- [ ] Install [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) and install node versions as needed
- [ ] Install [`pnpm`](http://pnpm.io/) (and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/)/[`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) as needed)
- [ ] Install [`sfdx && sf`](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) (NOTE: if you install via `pnpm || npm || yarn`, you wont get the `sf` cli - this may change in the future).
- [ ] Setup [`git` config files](https://github.com/lukethacoder/.../blob/master/.gitconfig)
- [ ] Setup GPG keys. Ideally use the GPG tool that comes installed with `git` [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).

Depending on the machine, I'll run a [choco script](https://github.com/lukethacoder/choco-milk) to bulk install the rest of the software/programs.
